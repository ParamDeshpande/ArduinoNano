does basic (only either of the 1) light / fan / appliance toggling for a **𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧** entry / exit basis

2nd)
Lazyboyproto
does the same shit as above but also supports multiple lights / fans / appliances , counts the no of people inside the room and supports multiple people, has dedicated buttons for prefrence (ie you can choose which appliance you want active and which inactive when you enter), and lastly a 16x2 lcd screen to display the stats (can be controlled by one those damn buttons a well)leds // can be used in both the models (optional)
